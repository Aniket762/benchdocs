This is a guide to get started with the project. This is written more like a `hello-world` like manner, in order to
keep it simple.

Running Bench-routes requires 2 files:
1. Binary file
2. Configuration file (as `local-config.yml`)

The binary file can be downloaded and installed by following the instructions from [here](./install.md). Once you have downloaded
you need to ensure that you have a `local-config.yml` file.
